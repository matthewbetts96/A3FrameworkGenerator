Welcome!

So in this quick guide I will aim to tell you how to use A3GearScriptGenerator.

Setup:

1. Extract this .zip to anywhere on your PC 

2. Download F3 from here https://github.com/ferstaberinde/F3

3. Place the framework in a mission folder so it looks like this http://puu.sh/sdUuQ/34287fe4e6.png NOTE: Some things are slightly different for me (different jpeg image and a ca folder) this is due to me using my communities forked version of F3.

4. Go to \f\assignGear and delete all files bar the insignia folder. It now should look like this http://puu.sh/sdUq7/4a7201a1da.png

5. Go to the location where you extracted the A3GearScriptGenerator and run the exe. (You can also compile the py file, but both do the same thing. NOTE: py 3.4 is required)

6. Two windows should load up and look like this http://puu.sh/sdULY/51f3ebe6e6.png We can ignore the command line for now. It is only used to check if entries go in correctly.

Okay now you have the program running you can now use it. But how do you? Well lets find out.

The generator is split up into 4 sections. 

	- Global side variable (RED)
	- Unit weapons entry (BLACK)
	- Clothes entry (GREEN) 
	- Generation variables (BROWN) 

Q:What is the Global side variable?
	
A: The Global side variable is what the file will be called. It is akin to a faction name like NATO/PACT. This variable can be whatever you want it to be as long as it is the same across all units in that faction.

Q:What is the Unit name variable then?

A: This defines the role of the unit within the faction such as rifleman/medic etc. To create a unit, fill in the Global side variable, the unit name variable and whatever weapons/ammo you want to give the unit in the appropriate fields. Once that is done, it the submit button and a notification box should have popped up. This means that is successful. You can then move onto the next unit.

Q:Okay so what about clothes?

A: It is nearly the same as units with a few differences. You still must fill in the Global side variable but not the unit name. This is due to the gear being randomly selected from the ones that you submit for every unit rather than being assigned on a per unit basis. 
NOTE: You do not need to submit the gear in full sets and some slots can be empty
NOTE 2: Currently you must also only submit one bit of gear per field per submision

Q:Okay now everything is entered how do I generate the files?

A: Easy. Fill in the Global side variable with the side that you have given gear for that you want to generate, tick the boxes (ie ticking 'Map?' will give all the units maps) and it does the rest of the work for you. In the same folder as the exe should be 3 files. I created a faction called 'marine' (I put marine in the unit side) and it generated these files http://puu.sh/sdWlp/66cef94f11.png Once you have your files, copy them over to your assignGear folder like so http://puu.sh/sdWsW/a65fbd36c1.png


A: It's very similar to the original F3. To call a 'medic' from the 'marine' side you just put this into it's init line ["medic",this,"marine"] call f_fnc_assignGear; and wa la! you're all ready to go.


Also please note that this isn't a final version and some things are not supported yet, such as aar's and a few other smaller things.
